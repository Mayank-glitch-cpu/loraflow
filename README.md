# LoraFlow is JSON based messaging system for LoRa modules
* Single channel
* Simple addressing
* Low power consumption (only 0.15mA with Arduino mini)
![GreenHouse example](https://github.com/loraflow-net/loraflow/blob/master/img/greenhouse.png)

## Installation
1) git clone https://github.com/loraflow-net/loraflow.git
2) chmod +x loraflow/install
3) ./loraflow/install
4) "sudo nano -w loraflow/loraflow.py" and add onlinedb.net API KEY (Free Service)

## Why Lora is perfect technology for IoT messaging?
## Benefits: 
* Long distance (up to 8km)
* Energy efficient
* Cheap hardware
* Hardware is small in size
* No existing infrastructure is required
